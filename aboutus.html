        <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>
          Royal Pacific Vault has been in existence for many years and to our credit, the
          company is registered with the Internationally recognized Quality Standard
          Organization (ISO), to which we steadily moving through all requisite stages for
          final certification. Our link with (I.S.O) helps to describe our internal work
          processes and gives us a framework for monitoring our processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Existing clients include government departments, financial institutions, attorneys,
          accounting firms, hotels, industries and private individuals. Our rates are
          reasonable and we have long list of satisfied clients. OUR MISSION We believe that
          real security challenges require real security solutions by competent professionals.
          Anything else represents failure to acknowledge the obvious and worst, failure to
          address reasonably foreseeable liabilities.

        <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
        <p>
          To accomplish these objectives, we have combined the Israeli doctrine of security
          with the American tradition of customer service. Early on, we decided to develop
          State legacy Securities as a boutique service company for the premium services.
          We focus in addressing the challenges of clients who understand their needs and
          value the combination of our expertise, service and responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that instead of trying to saturate a client with large numbers of
          inexperienced, low paid security guards and rows of poorly monitored cameras,
          Royal Pacific vault actively engages with the task at hand and develops an
          effective set of operational methods for preventing security breaches. While no
          security apparatus is fail-proof, our philosophy is that a single trained security
          guard, backed by an effective, computerized database and state of the art security
          technology, is far more effective than five poorly trained security guards who have
          a limited understanding of the "big picture".
